#TWO point Oh!
-  PyTexas 2014: [A D&D-based guide to Contribution and Inclusion in the Python Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpd9ms2v3Yc)
    +  my notes & slides - https://github.com/kojoidrissa/PyTexas2014
-  Lots of Dungeons and Dragons references, if you're into that sort of thing.

#WHY?
##Building a strong "party"
-  If you're looking for people to contribute to your project or community, you want as **many** awesome people as you can get.
-  More than one type of *awesome*

##Political Correctness vs. Diversity vs. Inclusiveness
-  My non-scientific definitions
-  Diversity vs. Inclusion vs. Political Correctness
    +  Political correctness: I hate `derogatory term for a group of people` but I've been told I can't call them `derogatory term`. I'm supposed to call them `PC term for a group of people`.
    +  Diversity: Lots of different *types* of people
    +  Inclusion: Welcoming to all who wish to peacefully co-exist or contribute
-  Inherent Limits on the community
    +  tech is "hard", requires 'rigor'; as such, some people won't want to do it
+  Talent myth creates additional barriers

#How
-  Check your assumptions
    +  "You made an assumption you didn't realize you'd made."
    +  *What does an **X** look like?*
        +  Jacob Kaplan-Moss' "[Three Faces of Zuckerberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJdFxYlEKE)" 23:11 in.
    -  An assumption I heard IN THIS ROOM a few years ago
+  'import this' on Inclusiveness
    -  Errors pass silently (which Zen of Python does NOT like)
        +  Errors should never pass silently.
    -  Although practicality beats purity.
    -  In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    -  Now is better than never.
        +  Although never is often better than *right* now.
-  Learn to interact with people outside your immediate sphere
    +  don't just talk to other coders
        +  non-programmers are the LARGEST growth vector for Python
        +  Python's clean, readable, understandable syntax makes it inviting to "non-programmers"
    -  Anna Ravenscroft, at about 50 minutes, suggests you "bring someone who is NOT like you" to the next EuroPython (or Python conference).
-  Ignore legal requirements
    +  no one wants to feel "forced"
-  Consider the feelings of others
-  Practice inclusivity in your local Python community
-  Have a wider range of people at your local Python events
