#TWO point Oh!
-  PyTexas 2014: [A D&D-based guide to Contribution and Inclusion in the Python Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpd9ms2v3Yc)
    +  my notes & slides - https://github.com/kojoidrissa/PyTexas2014
-  Lots of Dungeons and Dragons references, if you're into that sort of thing.

#WHY?
##Building a strong "party"
-  If you're looking for people to contribute to your project or community, you want as **many** awesome people as you can get.
-  More than one type of *awesome*

##Political Correctness vs. Diversity vs. Inclusiveness
-  My non-scientific definitions
-  Diversity vs. Inclusion vs. Political Correctness
    +  Political correctness: I hate `derogatory term for a group of people` but I've been told I can't call them `derogatory term`. I'm supposed to call them `PC term for a group of people`.
    +  Diversity: Lots of different *types* of people
    +  Inclusion: Welcoming to all who wish to peacefully co-exist or contribute
-  Inherent Limits on the community
    +  tech is "hard", requires 'rigor'; as such, some people won't want to do it
+  Talent myth creates additional barriers
    *  "We'll know we've been really succesful when there are a whole bunch of average women programmers." [Lynn Root](http://www.roguelynn.com/about/), in a conversation w/ Jacob Kaplan-Moss that inspired Jacob's PyCon 2015 Keynote.
