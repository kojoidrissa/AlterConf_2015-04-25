#TWO point Oh!
-  PyTexas 2014: [A D&D-based guide to Contribution and Inclusion in the Python Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpd9ms2v3Yc)
    +  my notes & slides from that talk - https://github.com/kojoidrissa/PyTexas2014
-  Lots of Dungeons and Dragons references, if you're into that sort of thing.

#WHY?

#Building a strong "party"
-  If you're looking for people to contribute to your project or community, you want as **many** awesome people as you can get.
-  More than one type of *awesome*

#Political Correctness vs. Diversity vs. Inclusiveness
-  Why I prefer "Inclusiveness": my non-scientific definitions
-  **Political correctness**: I don't like `derogatory term for a group` but I've been told I can't call them `derogatory term`. I'm supposed to call them `PC term for a group`.
    +  a 'naive solution'
    +  often makes a bad situation worse
-  **Diversity**: Lots of different *types* of people
    +  another 'naive solution'
    +  easy to measure; also easy to 'game'
-  **Inclusion**: Welcoming to all who wish to peacefully co-exist or contribute
    +  more complicated to implement

#Why does this matter?
-  Inherent limits on each community
    +  tech is "hard", requires 'rigor'; as such, some people won't want to do it
    +  of those who WILL, will they contribute to YOUR community?
-  Talent myth creates additional barriers

#How: Practicing Inclusivity

#Check your assumptions
+  "You made an assumption you didn't realize you'd made."
+  *What does an **X** look like?*
    +  Jacob Kaplan-Moss' "[Three Faces of Zuckerberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJdFxYlEKE)" 23:11 in.
-  An assumption I heard IN THIS ROOM a few years ago

#'import this' on Inclusiveness
-  Errors should never pass silently (which Zen of Python does NOT like)
    +  Problems are likely to pass silently, so you need to be vigilant
-  Although practicality beats purity
    +  the point of this talk
    +  "Agree with me or be a terrible person!" vs. "Here's how this can help you"
-  In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess
    +  race/gender/identity/ethnicity: 
-  Now is better than never.
    +  Although never is often better than *right* now.

#Learn to interact with people outside your immediate sphere
+  don't just talk to other tech or gaming people
    +  non-programmers are the LARGEST growth vector for Python
    +  Python's clean, readable, understandable syntax makes it inviting to "non-programmers"
-  Anna Ravenscroft, [Diversity as a Dependency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLYI46Ou-wI) at about 50 minutes, suggests you "bring someone who is NOT like you" to the next conference.

#Don't focus primarily on "legal compliance"
+  a "forced" effort is a doomed effort

#Consider the feelings of others
-  How would you feel if the demographics were reversed?

---

#What if you can't?
If your heart's not really into it or you feel it's "too hard", be honest with yourself and just hang around others like you. Recognize that this behavior may leave you isolated from a large (and growing) portion of the community.

#Final Words

##[Just as systems tend towards entropy, if you leave a community alone it tends towards toxicity. Good communities require continual effort.](https://twitter.com/jacobian/status/514104755660914688)

That goes for people too, especially **me**. It's a process/journey, not a product/destination.
