-  Talk title: Discussing Practical Inclusivity
-  Talk description: I'll talk about discussing Inclusivity with people who may not understand why it matters. The "why" focuses on functional benefits of being Inclusive, especially as they relate to the FLOSS technology space. Next, I'll move on to the "how": what steps can people take to help foster more Inclusion?
-  Talk Time: 20 minutes
